name: CI
      
# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  #when there is a push to the master
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  #when there is a pull to the master
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    # does this mean that the files in my github repo are accessible by this YAML file?
